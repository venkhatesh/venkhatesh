# 👋 Hey there, I'm Venkhatesh Arunachalam! 🚀

I’m a Machine Learning & Data Engineer passionate about building real-world AI systems that scale — and make a difference.

Right now, I’m working at **Fidari Care** as a Software Engineer – Machine Learning, where I’m helping improve oncology care using large language models. I work on everything from building RAG pipelines with multimodal LLMs to optimizing healthcare data pipelines in Spark and Airflow. When I’m not wrangling EHR data or deploying ML infra, I’m probably tweaking workflows to make our models a little faster, a little smarter, and a lot more useful.
